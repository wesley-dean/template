# <ADR Title>

Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Status

<Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded>

## Intent and Documentation Posture

This Architecture Decision Record is intended to be **thorough and expressive**, not minimal.
More detail is preferred over brevity when it helps preserve context, nuance, trade-offs,
and decision rationale.

Future updates and related ADRs should assume a **"more is more"** approach:
- Capture reasoning, not just outcomes
- Record alternatives seriously considered, even if rejected
- Preserve tone, framing, and human or organizational constraints
- Favor clarity and completeness over concision

This ADR is expected to be consumed and reused by both humans and LLM-based tools.

## Context

Describe the situation that led to this decision.

Include:
- The problem or tension being addressed
- Technical, organizational, human, or strategic constraints
- Relevant background from prior ADRs or discussions
- Pressures, risks, incentives, or non-obvious factors influencing the decision
- Why this decision matters *now*

This section should favor narrative completeness over summarization.

## Decision Drivers

List the key factors that most strongly influenced the decision.

Examples:
- Risk management considerations
- Cost or opportunity cost
- Human factors (cognitive load, trust, accountability, morale)
- Organizational dynamics (PM–dev–exec interfaces, governance, compliance)
- Alignment with project philosophy or values
- Long-term maintainability or extensibility

This section exists to make the *why* behind the decision explicit.

## Decision

State the decision clearly and unambiguously.

Describe:
- What is being decided
- The intended outcome
- Any important boundaries or non-goals
- How this decision should be interpreted in practice

If helpful, include a short summary sentence followed by a more detailed explanation.

## Considered Alternatives

Document the alternatives that were discussed or evaluated.

For each alternative, include:
- A brief description
- Why it was considered
- Why it was not selected

Rejected alternatives are valuable context and should be preserved.

## Consequences

Describe the results of this decision, including both benefits and costs.

Include:
- Expected positive outcomes
- Trade-offs and downsides
- Risks introduced or accepted
- Impacts on future work or decisions
- Areas that may need revisiting as the project evolves

This section should reflect realistic consequences, not just optimistic ones.

## Open Questions and Follow-Ups

List any unresolved questions, assumptions, or areas requiring future validation.

Include:
- What remains unknown
- What might cause this ADR to be revisited
- Signals or conditions that would justify a change in direction

## Related Decisions

List related ADRs or documents.

Examples:
- Supersedes: ADR-00X
- Superseded by: ADR-00Y
- Related to: ADR-00Z
