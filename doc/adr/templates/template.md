# NUMBER. TITLE

<!--
This is a template for drafting Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).  It
may be used and consumed by humans as well as AI/LLM-based tooling.

There are placeholders used in this template:
- NUMBER: the ADR's number
- TITLE: the title of the ADR
- DATE: the date the ADR was drafted (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- STATUS: the status of the ADR (Accepted, Proposed, etc.)

Replace the placeholders when drafting the ADR before committing it.

This template is compatible with Nat Pryce's ADR tools found at:

https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/tree/master

If you want to use this template with adr-tools, place it in your repository
at:

doc/adr/templates/template.md

Creating a new ADR with adr-tools can then be accomplished with `adr new`.
-->

Date: DATE

<!--
This is the date that the ADR was drafted written in YYYY-MM-DD format.
-->

## Status

STATUS

<!--
Specify the current status of this ADR.

It is often safe to assume "accepted" here when this ADR is used in a Source
Code Management (SCM) system as the review process resulting in the ADR being
added to the repository may represent the acceptance of the ADR.  Your team
may use different rules or conventions, so update this template as-needed
-->

## Intent and Documentation Posture

<!--
This ADR is intended to be thorough and expressive, not minimal.  More detail
is preferred over brevity when it helps preserve context, nuance, trade-offs,
and decision rationale.

Future updates and related ADRs should assume a "more is more" approach:
- Capture reasoning, not just outcomes
- Record alternatives seriously considered, even if rejected
- Preserve tone, framing, and human or organizational constraints
- Favor clarity and completeness over concision

This ADR is expected to be consumed and reused by both humans and LLM-based
tools.
-->

## Context

<!--
Describe the situation that led to this decision.

Include:
- The problem or tension being addressed
- Technical, organizational, human, or strategic constraints
- Relevant background from prior ADRs or discussions
- Pressures, risks, incentives, or non-obvious factors influencing the decision
- Why this decision matters *now*

This section should favor narrative completeness over summarization.
-->

## Decision Drivers

<!--
List the key factors that most strongly influenced the decision.

Examples:
- Risk management considerations
- Cost or opportunity cost
- Human factors (cognitive load, trust, accountability, morale)
- Organizational dynamics (PM–dev–exec interfaces, governance, compliance)
- Alignment with project philosophy or values
- Long-term maintainability or extensibility

This section exists to make the *why* behind the decision explicit.
-->

## Decision

<!--
State the decision clearly and unambiguously.

Describe:
- What is being decided
- The intended outcome
- Any important boundaries or non-goals
- How this decision should be interpreted in practice

If helpful, include a short summary sentence followed by a more detailed
explanation.
-->

## Considered Alternatives

<!--
Document the alternatives that were discussed or evaluated.

For each alternative, include:
- A brief description
- Why it was considered
- Why it was not selected

Rejected alternatives are valuable context and should be preserved.
-->

## Consequences

<!--
Describe the results of this decision, including both benefits and costs.

Include:
- Expected positive outcomes
- Trade-offs and downsides
- Risks introduced or accepted
- Impacts on future work or decisions
- Areas that may need revisiting as the project evolves

This section should reflect realistic consequences, not just optimistic ones.
-->

## Open Questions and Follow-Ups

<!--
List any unresolved questions, assumptions, or areas requiring future validation.

Include:
- What remains unknown
- What might cause this ADR to be revisited
- Signals or conditions that would justify a change in direction
-->

## Related Decisions

<!--
List related ADRs or documents.

Examples:
- Supersedes: ADR-00X
- Superseded by: ADR-00Y
- Related to: ADR-00Z

This section helps future readers and tools navigate decision lineage.
