# Welcome

I'm so glad you're thinking about contributing to an open source project.
If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue
or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be
politely asked to change something. I love all friendly contributions!

I encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy
(you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](/README.md).
