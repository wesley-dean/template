# Security Policy

## Introduction

This document outlines the security policies for this repository.  It is
important to note that this repository is a personal project and is not
officially supported by any organization.  As such, the security policies
outlined here are informal and may not be as robust as those of a larger
organization.

Attempts will be made to meet the best practices outlined in the
[FLOSS Best Practices Criteria](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria/0)
which are designed to help open source projects improve their security
posture.  However, this is not a guarantee of security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you wish to report or disclose a vulnerability, please send an email to
[security_vulnerability_disclosure@wesleydean.com](mailto:security_vulnerability_disclosure@wesleydean.com)
.  Good faith attempts will be made to address or mediate the disclosure within
30 days.  After that period, if the issue remains, please consider creating
an issue in the repository.
